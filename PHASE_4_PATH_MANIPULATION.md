# Phase 4 Implementation - Path Manipulation & Boolean Operations

## Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 4 "Path Manipulation & Boolean Operations" from the FontLab API roadmap. These provide essential path editing and boolean shape operations for professional font design automation through the MCP server.

## New Tools (Write operations)

### Boolean Operations (3 tools)

1. **`union_shapes`** - Union (combine) overlapping shapes in a glyph
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`
   - Combines all overlapping paths using removeOverlap()
   - Essential for merging multiple shapes into one

2. **`intersect_shapes`** - Intersect shapes (keep only overlapping areas)
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`
   - Keeps only the areas where shapes overlap
   - Requires at least 2 shapes in the glyph
   - Uses layer.intersectShapes() if available

3. **`subtract_shapes`** - Subtract shapes from the first shape
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`
   - Reverses subsequent shapes and removes overlaps
   - Requires at least 2 shapes in the glyph
   - Creates knockout/cutout effects

### Node Operations (5 tools)

4. **`add_node`** - Add a node to a contour at a specific position
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `contour_index`, `x`, `y`, `node_type` (optional: "curve", "line", "move")
   - Creates new flNode and adds to contour
   - Validates contour index range

5. **`remove_node`** - Remove a node from a contour
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `contour_index`, `node_index`
   - Removes node at specified index
   - Prevents removal if contour has ≤2 nodes
   - Validates both contour and node indices

6. **`move_node`** - Move an existing node to a new position
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `contour_index`, `node_index`, `x`, `y`
   - Updates node coordinates
   - Returns both old and new positions

7. **`convert_node_type`** - Convert a node type (curve/line/corner)
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `contour_index`, `node_index`, `node_type`
   - Changes node type using NodeType enum
   - Supports "curve", "line", "move"
   - Returns old and new types

8. **`smooth_node`** - Toggle smooth property of a node
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `contour_index`, `node_index`, `smooth` (boolean)
   - Sets node.smooth property
   - Affects how handles behave

### Path Operations (3 tools)

9. **`add_contour_from_points`** - Create a new contour from a list of points
   - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `points` (array of {x, y, type}), `closed` (optional)
   - Creates flContour with flNodes
   - Validates at least 2 points
   - Each point can specify type ("curve", "line", "move")

10. **`remove_contour`** - Remove a contour from a glyph by index
    - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `contour_index`
    - Removes specified contour from layer
    - Validates contour index

11. **`simplify_paths`** - Simplify/optimize contours by removing unnecessary nodes
    - Parameters: `glyph_name`, `tolerance` (optional, default 1.0)
    - Uses layer.simplify() method
    - Returns nodes before/after and count removed
    - Tolerance range: 0.1 to 100.0

**Total New Tools: 11**

## Implementation Details

### Security & Validation
- All glyph names validated for dangerous characters
- Numeric ranges enforced for coordinates (-10000 to 10000)
- String length limits for names (255 chars)
- Contour and node index validation
- Minimum node count validation (prevents contour corruption)
- Point list validation for add_contour_from_points

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try/catch in all bridge scripts
- Validation errors logged and returned to user
- Font/glyph existence checks
- Contour and node index range validation
- Shape count validation for boolean operations
- Type validation for node operations

### FontLab API Usage
- Uses `layer.removeOverlap()` for union operations
- Uses `layer.intersectShapes()` for intersection (if available)
- Uses `shape.reverse()` + removeOverlap for subtraction
- Uses `flNode()` and `NodeType` enum for node creation
- Uses `flContour()` and `layer.addShape()` for contour creation
- Uses `layer.removeShape(index)` for contour removal
- Uses `layer.simplify(tolerance)` for path optimization
- Calls `glyph.update()` for persistence after all operations

## API Reference Quick Start

### Boolean Operations

```python
# Union overlapping shapes
union_shapes(glyph_name="A")

# Intersect shapes (keep overlap)
intersect_shapes(glyph_name="ampersand")

# Subtract shapes (create knockout)
subtract_shapes(glyph_name="dollar")
```

### Node Operations

```python
# Add a node to a contour
add_node(
    glyph_name="A",
    contour_index=0,
    x=300,
    y=400,
    node_type="curve"  # or "line", "move"
)

# Remove a node
remove_node(
    glyph_name="A",
    contour_index=0,
    node_index=5
)

# Move a node
move_node(
    glyph_name="A",
    contour_index=0,
    node_index=3,
    x=350,
    y=450
)

# Convert node type
convert_node_type(
    glyph_name="A",
    contour_index=0,
    node_index=2,
    node_type="line"
)

# Set node smoothness
smooth_node(
    glyph_name="A",
    contour_index=0,
    node_index=1,
    smooth=True
)
```

### Path Operations

```python
# Create a contour from points
add_contour_from_points(
    glyph_name="square",
    points=[
        {"x": 100, "y": 100, "type": "line"},
        {"x": 500, "y": 100, "type": "line"},
        {"x": 500, "y": 500, "type": "line"},
        {"x": 100, "y": 500, "type": "line"}
    ],
    closed=True
)

# Remove a contour
remove_contour(
    glyph_name="A",
    contour_index=1
)

# Simplify paths
simplify_paths(
    glyph_name="imported",
    tolerance=2.0
)
```

## Testing Notes

To test these features, you'll need:
1. FontLab 7 or 8 installed
2. A font open in FontLab
3. The MCP server running and connected

Test scenarios:
- **Boolean**: Create overlapping circles, test union/intersect/subtract
- **Nodes**: Create a simple square, add/remove/move nodes
- **Paths**: Generate a triangle from coordinates, simplify traced artwork

## Design Decisions

### Boolean Operations
- `union_shapes` uses removeOverlap() as it's the most reliable method
- `intersect_shapes` checks for method availability and fails gracefully
- `subtract_shapes` uses shape reversal + removeOverlap pattern

### Node Indexing
- All indices are 0-based for consistency with Python
- Contour indices count only contours (skip components)
- Node indices are direct indices into contour.nodes array

### Validation Ranges
- Coordinates: -10000 to 10000 (generous for most font work)
- Tolerance: 0.1 to 100.0 (reasonable simplification range)
- Indices: Validated against actual counts to prevent crashes

## Next Steps
